# Falco Rules

[![Falco Core Repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/repos/badges/falco-core-blue.svg)](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/REPOSITORIES.md#core-scope) [![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/REPOSITORIES.md#stable) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/falcosecurity/rules?style=for-the-badge)](./LICENSE)

Note: *This repository has been created upon this [proposal](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/20221129-artifacts-distribution.md#move-falco-rules-to-their-own-repo).*

This repository contains the [Rules Files Registry](#registry) and *rules files* officially maintained by the Falcosecurity organization. [Rules](https://falco.org/docs/rules) tell [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco) what to do. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://falco.org/docs/rules) to better understand the rules' concepts. 

## Registry

The Registry contains metadata and information about rules files distributed by the Falcosecurity organization. These rules are developed for Falco and made available to the community. 

Note: _Currently, the registry includes only rules for the syscall call data source; for other data sources see the [plugins repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins)._

<!-- Check out the sections below to know how to [register your rules](#registering-a-new-rule) and see rules currently contained in the registry. -->

<!--
### Registering a new Rules file

Registering your rule inside the registry helps ensure that some technical constraints are respected. Moreover, this is a great way to share your ruleset and make it available to the community. We encourage you to register your ruleset in this registry before publishing it.

The registration process involves adding an entry about your rule inside the [registry.yaml](./registry.yaml) file by creating a Pull Request in this repository. Please be mindful of a few constraints that are automatically checked and required for your rule to be accepted:

- The `name` field is mandatory and must be **unique** across all the rule in the registry
- The rule `name` must match this [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression): `^[a-z]+[a-z0-9-_\-]*$` (however, its not reccomended to use `_` in the name)
- The `path` field should specify the path to the rule in this repository
- The `url` field should point to the ruleset file in the source code

For reference, here's an example of an entry for a rule:
```yaml
- name: falco-rules
  description: Falco rules that are loaded by default
  authors: The Falco Authors
  contact: https://falco.org/community
  maintainers:
    - name: The Falco Authors
      email: cncf-falco-dev@lists.cncf.io
  path: rules/falco_rules.yaml
  license: apache-2.0
  url: https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules/blob/main/rules/falco_rules.yaml
```

You can find the full registry specification here: *(coming soon...)*

### Registered Rules

Please refer to the automatically generated [rules_inventory/rules_overview.md](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules/blob/main/rules_inventory/rules_overview.md#falco-rules---detailed-overview) file for a detailed list of all the rules currently registered.

## Hosted Rules

Another purpose of this repository is to host and maintain the rules owned by the Falcosecurity organization. All the rules are contained inside the [rules](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules/tree/main/rules) folder.

The `main` branch contains the most up-to-date state of development. Please check our [Release Process](./RELEASE.md) to know how rules are released. Stable builds are released and published only when a new release gets tagged.

If you wish to contribute your rules to the Falcosecurity organization, you just need to open a Pull Request to add them inside the `rules` folder. In order to be hosted in this repository, rules must be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).
