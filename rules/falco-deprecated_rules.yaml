# Information about rules tags and fields can be found here: https://falco.org/docs/rules/#tags-for-current-falco-ruleset
# The initial item in the `tags` fields reflects the maturity level of the rules introduced upon the proposal https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules/blob/main/proposals/20230605-rules-adoption-management-maturity-framework.md
# `tags` fields also include information about the type of workload inspection (host and/or container), and Mitre Attack killchain phases and Mitre TTP code(s)
# Mitre Attack References:
# [1] https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/

# Starting with version 8, the Falco engine supports exceptions.
# However the Falco rules file does not use them by default.

# This macro `never_true` is used as placeholder for tuning negative logical sub-expressions, for example
# - macro: allowed_ssh_hosts
#   condition: (never_true)
# can be used in a rules' expression with double negation `and not allowed_ssh_hosts` which effectively evaluates
# to true and does nothing, the perfect empty template for `logical` cases as opposed to list templates.
# When tuning the rule you can override the macro with something useful, e.g.
# - macro: allowed_ssh_hosts
#   condition: (evt.hostname contains xyz)
- macro: never_true
  condition: (evt.num=0)

# RFC1918 addresses were assigned for private network usage
- list: rfc_1918_addresses
  items: ['"10.0.0.0/8"', '"172.16.0.0/12"', '"192.168.0.0/16"']

- macro: outbound
  condition: >
    (((evt.type = connect and evt.dir=<) or
      (evt.type in (sendto,sendmsg) and evt.dir=< and
       fd.l4proto != tcp and fd.connected=false and fd.name_changed=true)) and
     (fd.typechar = 4 or fd.typechar = 6) and
     (fd.ip != "0.0.0.0" and fd.net != "127.0.0.0/8" and not fd.snet in (rfc_1918_addresses)) and
     (evt.rawres >= 0 or evt.res = EINPROGRESS))

# Very similar to inbound/outbound, but combines the tests together
# for efficiency.

     (evt.rawres >= 0 or evt.res = EINPROGRESS))

- macro: ssh_port
  condition: (fd.sport=22)

# In a local/user rules file, you could override this macro to
# enumerate the servers for which ssh connections are allowed. For
# example, you might have a ssh gateway host for which ssh connections
# are allowed.
#
# In the main falco rules file, there isn't any way to know the
# specific hosts for which ssh access is allowed, so this macro just
# repeats ssh_port, which effectively allows ssh from all hosts. In
# the overridden macro, the condition would look something like
# "fd.sip="a.b.c.d" or fd.sip="e.f.g.h" or ..."
- macro: allowed_ssh_hosts
  condition: (never_true)

- rule: Disallowed SSH Connection
  desc: > 
    Detect any new SSH connection on port 22 to a host other than those in an allowed list of hosts. 
    This rule absolutely requires profiling your environment beforehand. Network-based rules are extremely 
    crucial in any security program, as they can often provide the only definitive evidence. However, 
    effectively operationalizing them can be challenging due to the potential for noise.

# These rules and supporting macros are more of an example for how to
# use the fd.*ip and fd.*ip.name fields to match connection
# information against ips, netmasks, and complete domain names.

# To use this rule, you should enable it and

# values that make sense for your environment.

# Note that this can be either individual IPs or netmasks

- rule: Outbound or Inbound Traffic not to Authorized Server Process and Port
  desc: > 
    Detect traffic to an unauthorized server process and port within pre-defined containers. 
    This rule absolutely requires profiling your environment beforehand and also necessitates adjusting the list of containers 
    to which this rule will be applied. The current expression logic will never evaluate to true unless the list is populated. 
    Network-based rules are extremely crucial in any security program, as they can often provide the only definitive evidence.
